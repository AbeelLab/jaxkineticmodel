### A Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) model simulator in Jax
A simulation tool implemented in using jax/diffrax for fast simulations and parameter estimation.

#### Important
If a file ends with _TORCH, it means it was taken from the pytorch implementation and has not been tested yet with jax.

#### Features
1.  SBML model loader for simulation and perturbation of parameters.
