# Loading SBML models

## SBML loader and simulation
SBML models can be loaded and simulated as follows. 


```python
{!code/sbml.py!}
```


## Percentage of similar models
Status report on a large collection of SBML models loaded from [biomodels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) and from a benchmark collection **[1]**. Discrepancies are models where we compared the output from JaxKineticModel to a simulation using tellurium **[2]**, a popular tool in systems biology. Discrepancies could be there because of numerical differences in the results, or potentially a missing feature in our current implementation (certain event rules are not implemented yet.)
